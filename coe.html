                <p><b>2. Exclusivity Rights</b></p>
                <p><b>The benefits of belonging</b></p>
                <p>The Global Freight Group is an alliance of independently-owned freight and logistics businesses located throughout the world.
                    <br/><br/>As a member, you have immediate access to a global network of business partners who will work with you on a profit sharing basis - providing you with a "local" office everywhere in the world to make sure that your customers' cargo gets to its final destination as fast and efficiently as possible.
                    <br/><br/>At the same time, you will become the "local" office in your country/territory for all the other members of the Group - handling incoming traffic from their customers.
                </p>
                <br/>

                <p><b>Low Costs</b></p>
                <p>Unlike some international freight associations, GFG from the beginning has determined to keep the costs of membership as low as possible. The organisation is non-profit making and employs only one full time member of staff (Group Administrator, Rachel Marchant, who is based in the UK). All other functions are carried out on a voluntary basis by the elected Directors.
                    <br/>
                    <br/><br/>All new members are required to pay a single entry free of US$1,000.00 prior to attendance at their first conference.
                    <br/><br/>The first level of membership (Observer) is billed at $1200.00 a year, as is the second level (Aspirant).
                    <br/><br/>Members who are approved following these trial periods can then be voted upon to become a Full Member. Full members have voting rights and are obliged to attend the Fall meeting every year. Full membership carries a US$500.00 entry fee and an annual subscription of US$1,650.00. This amount includes the registration fee for one delegate to attend the mandatory GFG meeting.
                </p>
                <br/>

                <p><b>Exclusive Rights</b></p>
                <p>Membership gives you the exclusive right to be the only GFG representative in your country or state. Retention of exclusivity is subject to the member meeting a number of obligations. If these criteria are not met, the group may seek a second member in that territory.</p>

                <br/>

                <p><b>Existing trading relationships</b></p>
                <p>If you have existing trading relationships with organisations outside GFG, the GFG will not insist you give these up. However, if you cannot offer the GFG member in that location any business they are unlikely to reciprocate. If this situation extends to five or more member territories and these members choose to complain about the lack of reciprocal trade, your exclusivity rights may be rescinded and a second member may be appointed in your territory.</p>

                <br/>

                <p><b>Conferences</b></p>
                <p>GFG holds two conferences every year. As well as enabling formal GFG business to be managed, the conferences provide the opportunity for members to hold face-to-face business meetings (usually over 800 separate meetings of this kind are held). This is the most cost-effective way of conducting business on a global scale.
                    <br/><br/>The group is constantly developing and seeking to improve. Therefore the conference format has been reviewed and now, instead of two fully scheduled conferences each year, there is one casual conference in Spring and the usual formal conference in the Fall. Full Members must attend the Fall conference.
                    <br/><br/>The new format means that members can expect to see all other members at the obligatory Fall conference, thus increasing business potential. The Spring meeting offers a casual environment for members to meet each other for business meetings without the formal structure of the Fall meeting or the focus being on group matters. The Directors will hold their meeting at both conferences in order to ensure the GFG continues to move forwards.
                </p>
                <br/>

                <p><b>Friendship</b></p>
                <p>Once a member, you will discover that extremely strong bonds develop with others members. One long-standing member describes GFG as the "Global Friendship Group" - a group that does business with each other, but does so in an atmosphere of trust and friendship.</p>

                <br/>

                <p><b>Requirements</b></p>

                <p><b>3. Member To Member Insurance</b></p>
                <p><b>Member Liability Insurance</b></p>
                <p>It was resolved at the Rio General Assembly meeting that GFG would implement a Members Liability Programme and it was further resolved that this would be mandatory.
                    <br/><br/>The operating procedure for the scheme will be that a GFG Committee will be appointed to finalize the setup and the structure of the programme. This committee will refine the scheme and will report to the General Assembly at each conference giving details of balances held, member's delinquency (if appropriate) and any claims dealt with by the committee.
                    <br/><br/>The purpose of the scheme is to amass a pool of funds from which members will be compensated for money lost in the event that a GFG member has become insolvent, has declared bankruptcy or otherwise disbanded. The fund may also compensate members in the event of a member leaving the Group and due funds being uncollectable, but the final decision on these situations will be determined by the committee.
                    <br/><br/>The compensation will be limited to a maximum of 80% of the fund balance to be divided proportionately between the claimants.
                    <br/><br/>As new members join the scheme, should they have a claim, it will be paid out proportionately to their contribution to date and they will only become fully vested after an agreed period of membership to the scheme. This can be effected by setting a cap for the fund, after which time original members would no longer pay and new members would continue to pay for the number of years equal to that for which founding members paid.
                    <br/><br/>The annual per company contribution to the funds will be $100 (US DOLLARS). There will be no refund in the case of a member leaving the GFG for any reason.
                    <br/><br/>Claims will only be honoured from fully paid members.
                    <br/><br/>The fund will be set up in a separate bank account and will operate on a non profit making basis.
                    <br/><br/>GFG will contribute its administrative services at no charge.
                    <br/><br/>Once claims are approved for payment, the claimant must sign over the debt to GFG for collection.
                    <br/><br/>The Member to Member Insurance Fund Chairman manages the fund.

                    <br/><br/>In the event that a member resigns, no fees are refundable. All subscriptions and fees will be billed annually in advance.
                    <br/><br/>Description of Process
                    <br/><br/>When a company meets the guidelines of the Association questionnaire and forward it to the Association Secretary. Upon the receipt of application, the Association Board of Directors may initiate investigations together with a visit by a Board member or member appointed by the Board. If the results of such investigations are positive, the following procedures will then be implemented:
                    <br/><br/>The company will be invited to meet with the Board of Directors at a Board meeting held immediately prior to a scheduled General Assembly. If the Board determines that the applying company meets the conditions of acceptance and can become a useful and productive member of the Association, then the following steps will apply:

                    <br/><br/>The Board of Directors will introduce the company to the General Assembly, and the company will be invited to become an Observer member for a period of six months from the date of the current General Assembly.
                    <br/><br/>Upon completing six months as an Observer member, having positively demonstrated their ability to generate cargo and cooperate with the Membership, and after review by the Board of Directors, the Observer member may be recommended by the Board to the General Assembly to become an Aspirant member for an additional period of six months. The General Assembly will vote on the recommendation.
                    <br/><br/>After six months as an Aspirant member, and after review by the Board of Directors, the applying company may be recommended and presented as a potential Full member to the General Assembly, who will vote on this recommendation.
                </p>
                <br/>

                <p><b>5. Expulsion Criteria</b></p>
                <p>By introducing these measures, the Board hope to expand the membership and create more business between members.
                    <br/><br/>If a member practices unethical behaviour and / or violates two or more criteria, the Board shall have the right to expel that member.
                    <br/><br/>1. Unethical behaviour as deemed by the BOD
                    <br/><br/>2. Monetary- delays / non-payment
                    <br/><br/>3. Non attendance at mandatory meetings outside the rules of the GFG
                    <br/><br/>4. Communications / service failure issues resulting in formal complaints from 5 or more members
                    <br/><br/>5. Soliciting business outside own territory amongst the GFG membership
                    <br/><br/>Any violation will result in the right for the BOD to put that member forward for a vote of expulsion at the General Assembly.
                    <br/><br/>The member would be given the opportunity to defend themselves prior to the vote taking place.  
                </p>
                <br/>

                <p><b>6. Penalties</b></p>

                    <p>Even after 21 years, and the fact that most of its founding members continue their membership, the GFG is not complacent.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>The GFG is one of the world's original, exclusive networks. The fact that one or two other groups now offer exclusivity proves we are doing it right and, since "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery", we thank them for their compliment.</p>
